Copy Constructor --
let s1 have age as 10 and rollNo as 24, and now we want to create s2 such that it has same values
one way ->  s2.age = s1.age; and s2.rollNo = s1.rollNo; ,,,else we can also use copy assignment operator (i.e, s2 = s1), which ultimately meant the same (s2.age = s1.age; and s2.rollNo = s1.rollNo;)
NOTE: we can use s2 = s1; only if s2 is created before with some values present in s2.
But , using creating s2, copy constructor it will be more easy; we can call copy constructor as --
student s2(s1); // this will make copy of s1 as s2 will all properties and values of s1.
internally,, student s2(s1); is interpreted as s2.student(s1);
